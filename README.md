# Development Templates

A collection of templates I collected over the years to get started quickly with development. 

- [Bash](bash/)
- [Maven / Java](maven/java/)
- Gradle
    + [Kotlin/JS library](gradle/kotlinjs/lib)
    + [Kotlin/JS application](gradle/kotlinjs/app) 

Each template contains a README describing the template and how to get started.

If you find this useful, I'd be happy if you leave a star. If you have suggestions how to improve this, please open an issue or PR.

Thanks & have fun!
